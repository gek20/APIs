### ACCESS WITH CREDENTIALS
This is a toy example to add a user in the DB and how to use authentication (password) to perform some actions.

## How to run the code:
1. run the server.py file. Change host and port if you want (default host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
2. run the test.py file to verity that it is working correctly (change address if needed)
3. if you passed all the test you should have created a db file with a "user" table with user and hash and a "object" table with the laptop info
